#Hello, I'm Tom 👋
I'm a Bioanalytical Scientist :pill:  studying to become a Data Scientist :computer:

###Intro
Answering questions :thinking: using data has always been my favourite part of bioanalysis;   
🔬 *Is this drug working?*     
📉 *What's the optimal dose?*      
🌡️ *Are we seeing an immune response?*


As my career has progressed :ladder: and I began managing projects and then people, I enjoyed harnessing data in different ways:    
💰 *What was our revenue this month?*    
📊 *How is everyone's workload?*    
👥 *Are we resourced properly?*    

I've defintely been an amateur data "scientist" up to this point, getting by on enthusiasm and no reluctance to ask questions. But now I'm studying to learn new skills, technologies and techniques, hoping to become an actual Data Scientist
